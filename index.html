<h2>Welcome to Dave's Devil Sticks</h2>

<p>If you are looking for juggling balls, hacky sacks, pins, unicycles, or magic hats, you've come to the wrong place; but if you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted devil and flower sticks, this is the site for you. I've been designing and building sticks for the past 20 years, and I know that my sticks are the best of their kind.</p>

	<h2>Specials This Month</h2>

<p>The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for the entire month of September:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Stick ($19.95)
The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.</li>
               
<li>Flower Stick ($24.95)
A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks float slowly, making them ideal for beginners.</li>

<li>Master Stick ($39.95)
Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.</li>

<li>Glow Stick ($29.95)
The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick).</li>
</ul>              
<h2>Quality Tested</h2>

<p>Every item I create is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my sticks and I want  my customers to feel that same pride.</p>
